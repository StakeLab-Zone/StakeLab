# Public-Endpoints
Public endpoints are part of the Cosmos scalability, providing data and making possible the ecosystem open source scalability.  
StakeLab provide these public endpoints for developers that wants to start building on one of our supported networks to start their Cosmos journey.  
If you are one of our supported network, or one we don't support but would like us to support it, please reach us at endpoints@stakelab.fr.  
**You are free to send native coins from each blockchains to support us and the cost of the operations in our Relayers wallets. If you prefer, you can also delegate to our Validators**
